# UCSD: Data Structures & Algorithms Specialization

**Course 1: [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://github.com/biz-whitney/Coursera-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Specialization-/tree/master/Algorithmic%20Toolkit)**  <br />
The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming.


**Course 2: [Data Structures](https://github.com/biz-whitney/Coursera-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Specialization-/tree/master/Data%20Structures%20)**  <br />
In this course, we consider the common data structures that are used in various computational problems. You will learn how these data structures are implemented in different programming languages and will practice implementing them in our programming assignments.

**Course 3: [Algorithms on Graphs](https://github.com/biz-whitney/Coursera-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Specialization-/tree/master/Algorithms%20on%20Graphs%20)** <br />
In this course, you will first learn what a graph is and what are some of the most important properties. Then you'll learn several ways to traverse graphs and how you can do useful things while traversing the graph in some order.

**Course 4: [Algorithms on Strings](https://github.com/biz-whitney/Coursera-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Specialization-/tree/master/Algorithms%20on%20Strings)** <br />
World and internet is full of textual information. We search for information using textual queries, we read websites, books, e-mails. All those are strings from the point of view of computer science. To make sense of all that information and make search efficient, search engines use many string algorithms. Moreover, the emerging field of personalized medicine uses many search algorithms to find disease-causing mutations in the human genome.

**Course 5: Advanced Algorithms and Complexity** <br />
This course begins with networks flows which are used typical applications such as optimal matchings, finding disjoint paths and flight scheduling as well as more surprising ones like image segmentation in computer vision. We then proceed to linear programming with applications in optimizing budget allocation, portfolio optimization, finding the cheapest diet satisfying all requirements and many others.

**Course 6: Genome Assembly Programming Challenge** <br />
In this Genome Assembly Programming Challenge, you will follow in the footsteps of the bioinformaticians investigating the deadliest E.coli outbreak in history by developing a program to assemble the genome of the E. coli X from millions of overlapping substrings of the E.coli X genome.
