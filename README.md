# UCSD: Data Structures & Algorithms Specialization

**Course 1: Algorithmic Toolbox**  <br />
The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming.


**Course 2: Data Structures**  <br />
In this course, we consider the common data structures that are used in various computational problems. You will learn how these data structures are implemented in different programming languages and will practice implementing them in our programming assignments.
