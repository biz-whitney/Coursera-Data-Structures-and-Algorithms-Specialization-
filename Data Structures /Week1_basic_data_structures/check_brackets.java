/*
Task. Your friend is making a text editor for programmers. He is currently working on a feature 
    that will find errors in the usage of different types of brackets. Code can contain any 
    brackets from the set []{}(), where the opening brackets are [,{, and ( and the closing 
    brackets corresponding to them are ],}, and ). For convenience, the text editor should not 
    only inform the user that there is an error in the usage of brackets, but also point to the 
    exact place in the code with the problematic bracket. First priority is to find the first 
    unmatched closing bracket which either doesn‚Äôt have an opening bracket before it, like ] 
    in ](), or closes the wrong opening bracket, like } in ()[}. If there are no such mistakes, 
    then it should find the first unmatched opening bracket without the corresponding closing 
    bracket after it, like ( in {}([]. If there are no mistakes, text editor should inform the 
    user that the usage of brackets is correct. Apart from the brackets, code can contain big 
    and small latin letters, digits and punctuation marks. More formally, all brackets in the 
    code should be divided into pairs of matching brackets, such that in each pair the opening 
    bracket goes before the closing bracket, and for any two pairs of brackets either one of 
    them is nested inside another one as in (foo[bar]) or they are separate as in f(a,b)-g[c]. 
    The bracket [ corresponds to the bracket ], { corresponds to }, and ( corresponds to ).

Input Format. Input contains one string ùëÜ which consists of big and small latin letters, digits, punctuation marks and brackets from the set []{}().


Output Format. If the code in ùëÜ uses brackets correctly, output ‚ÄúSuccess" (without the quotes). 
    Otherwise, output the 1-based index of the first unmatched closing bracket, and if there are 
    no unmatched closing brackets, output the 1-based index of the first unmatched opening bracket.

####### Sample 1 ########
Input:
[]

Output:
Success

####### Sample 2 ########
Input:
{}[]

Output:
Success

####### Sample 3 ########
Input:
(())

Output:
Success

####### Sample 4 ########
Input:
(

Output:
1
